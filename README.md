A rest based api service to track students.

## Student Object
A student consists of the following fields:
name - name of student
grade - overall GPA of student
update - last update to student record
id - generated id to track student
subject - subject the student is enrolled in

Currently all fields store a single value. Plans to change this in future revisions.
